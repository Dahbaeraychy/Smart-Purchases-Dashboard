# Smart-Purchases-Dashboard
Smart Purchases Dashboard is a UX improvement concept built on top of Gmail’s existing Purchases tab. The goal is to transform the current filtered-email view into a more intuitive and helpful dashboard that organizes purchases, tracks order statuses, and provides light spending insights without needing to open every email one by one.
